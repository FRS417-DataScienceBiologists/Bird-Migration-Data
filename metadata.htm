      <b>INTRODUCTION</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Migration of birds is an exciting phenomenon in animal behavior. Millions of birds migrate from breeding grounds to over-wintering areas and back again every year. Birds have thereby caught the interest of amateurs and ornithologists alike so that arrival and departure of various species at specific sites have been recorded for almost two centuries or longer (Lehikoinen et al. 2004: p. 3). The intensity of migration for a given species depends on several factors, e.g. on population dynamics, breeding success, climate, weather conditions, winter survival, and on the locality where the migration census is monitored. Across the European mainland, visible diurnal migration of offspring and parental birds is well documented in late summer and fall, and several counting sites are under systematic surveillance (e.g. coast lines or topographic 'hot spots' like mountain passes). The intensity of back migration from over-wintering sites in spring, however, is rather poorly documented with only few systematic studies available (e.g. LWVT/SOVON 2002). This is probably because of the overall reduced population size due to mortality at over-wintering sites and during migration (e.g. LWVT/SOVON 2002; Armbruster et al. 2005). Here, we present an online archive on the intensity of spring migration. The data represent a comprehensive, fine-grained set of records from an observation site at Lake Constance (Bodensee; southern Germany). Bird census was done in three consecutive years in the mid-eighties, i.e. more than 25 years ago. Our database will allow interested scientists to conduct further analyses, e.g.  i) on daily migration patterns, ii) on weather conditions and migration, and on iii) species comparison in migration behavior. Furthermore, the database might also provide comparative evidence for methodologically similar studies conducted in the future. Results of our field study have been summarized in Armbruster et al. (2005).

      <b>Abstract: </b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Millions of birds migrate each year between breeding grounds and overwintering areas. Migration behavior is influenced by a number of factors: day length, physiological and genetic factors, the magnetic compass, population dynamics, and by weather and climatic conditions. Historical and current data on avian migration are of broad scientific value. Most of the information on avian migration is presented in the form of summary statistics (e.g., duration of migration, number of individuals, trend line over years) in published studies, but original data sets are not readily available. Here, we describe the first open-source archive on visible diurnal spring migration in Central Europe. The database comprises the records of a systematic field study, which covers 35541 records of migrating birds for more than 138000 specimens of 96 species. Data were collected during the spring periods of 1984, 1985, and 1986. Bird census was conducted at the tip of the Höri peninsula in Lake Constance, Germany (north of the Alps: 47°41'49.11" N, 9°00'21.52" E). Migrating birds were counted from the  beginning of March to the beginning of May each morning using fine-grained 15-min intervals. Flock size, migration heading, and weather conditions are provided for each species, e.g., for the European Chaffinch <i>Fringilla coelebs</i>. In all three years we found evidence that  Chaffinches ceased to migrate to northeastern and eastern directions at the end of the observation period. The migration pattern of two thrush species (<i>Turdus merula</i> and <i>T. viscivorus</i>) is also presented in more detail. <i>Turdus merula</i> had its  migration peak always early in the morning, whereas migration of <i>T. viscivorus</i> was recorded from the early morning onward, with a peak at late morning to noon. Migration records are also documented for species that are generally believed as resident birds in the inland of Central Europe (e.g., <i>Streptopelia decaocto</i>, <i>Parus palustris, Certhia brachydactyla, Pica pica</i>). Our archive might be of significance for studying patterns of daily migration, e.g., the effect of weather on spring migration intensity and for methodological studies on the same issue</font>.    </p>

      <b>B. Specific subproject description</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Site description:</b> Migrating birds were counted in all three years at exactly the same place (the tip of the Höri peninsula at the open lake bank, 395m a.s.l., at 47°41'49.11" N, 9°00'21.52" E). For better view on the area, see, e.g., Google Earth (<a href="http://www.google.com/earth/index.html">http://www.google.com/earth/index.html</a>). Vegetation belt at the lake bank consists of reed grass <i>Phragmites australis</i> (CAV.) STEUDEL, and a group of deciduous trees and conifers is situated near the counting site.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Site type:</b> The Höri peninsula in the western part of Lake Constance is up to 708 m a.s.l., and is predominately covered with forest, agricultural land and with small villages. The peninsula has a west–east orientation. Migrating birds mostly follow this W–E direction or follow the lake bank, and arrive at the tip of the peninsula in high number of individuals.    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Geography:</b> Lake Constance (the <i>Bodensee</i>) is 63 km long and a maximum of 14 km wide, and lies in the northern foreland of the Alps. It is a tri-national lake surrounded by Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. It is one of the biggest freshwater reservoirs of inland central Europe (water volume ca. 50 km<sup><font size="-1">3</font></sup>). The lake area was shaped during previous ice ages. The basin of the lake was excavated by huge glaciers. Surface elevation of the water is approximately 395 m a.s.l., with the lowest water level in February. Melting water of the Alps can raise the surface of the lake up to two meters in summer. The Rhine river is the outflow of the lake, and takes the water to the North Sea.    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Habitat:</b> see above.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Geology:</b> The slopes and hills around Lake Constance are mainly formed by ground moraines and molasses. The Alps reach the basin of the lake in the very southeast, at some places with spear rocks (i.e., 'Nagelfluh' conglomerate). Phonolitic and basaltic hills (formed by volcanoes in the Miocene) are in the northwest of the basin.    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Watersheds/hydrology:</b> see above.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Site history:</b> The observation site at the tip of the Höri peninsula is famous for watching diurnal spring migration. Local field ornithologists have known this place for many years. It is also a popular place in winter to watch water fowls, cormorants, and loons.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Climate:</b> The climate at Lake Constance is strongly influenced by its geographic position and its huge body of water. Mean annual temperature is about 8–9 °C. In winter, the climate is relatively mild with only 1–2 weeks of strong frost. In summer, daily temperatures can reach 25–32 °C. Table 1 shows detailed information of the weather station of Konstanz (located 47°40'34.5" N, 9°11'29.4" E), ca. 12 km east of the counting site. Additional time series on weather data can be found online in the open source archive of the Deutscher Wetterdienst (<a href="http://www.dwd.de">http://www.dwd.de</a>).    </p>

	<p>At Lake Constance, a warm southern wind named "Föhn" can blow, particularly in the southeastern part. Föhn winds sometimes take Mediterranean birds over the Alps to the lake. Precipitation in the lake basin follows a gradient from ca. 700 mm p.a. in the northwest to 1300 mm p.a. in the very southeast.</p>

      <b>Experimental design:</b> Data are the result of a three-year observational field study.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Design characteristics:</b> N/A
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sampling methods:</b> The observation site was occupied with one field ornithologist who was familiar with identifying migrating birds. In rare cases, two field ornithologists have done the census (see database). Most of the field work was done by the P.I. (GFJA). Birds were identified by eye, binoculars (8–10× magnification) and/or by typical migration calls. If possible, the migration heading of each specimen or bird flock was recorded when the birds crossed the counting point. Data were recorded in handwritten field protocols. Note that swifts (Apodidae) and swallows (Hirundinidae) do not appear in the database. This is because local individuals (e.g., hunting for insects) and actively migrating individuals could not be distinguished at the observation site.    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Taxonomy and systematics:</b> Latin names of birds follow Maumary et al. (2007). Note that the data entries of the Lesser Redpoll <i>Carduelis cabaret</i> may also comprise specimens of the Common Redpoll <i>Carduelis flammea</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Permit history:</b> A permit for visiting the tip of the Höri peninsula must be applied for at the Naturschutzbehörde Konstanz (i.e., the government department of nature conservation, county of Konstanz). The area is under protection, and access is restricted.

We searched for outliers, and looked for irregularities by running different sorting procedures for each species. We eventually noticed that 7th May 1984 is a "real" missing day (the observation site was not occupied by a field ornithologist).

		Tables 2, 3, and 4 (below) show details in the migration heading of the European Chaffinch <i>Fringilla coelebs</i> at the observation site in each year. E, NE, and N indicate directions across the lake, whereas other directions are more inland or lake bank directions. Two time spans are compared: beginning of March (start of the bird census) until 20th of April (denoted with March-April), and 21st of April until May (end of the bird census; denoted with EndApril-May). Chaffinches ceased to migrate in an E and NE direction at EndApril-May in each year. This finding could indicate that chaffinches heading to breeding sites in northeastern and eastern Europe may have passed the foreland of the Alps before 20th of April. Alternatively, one could speculate that migration instinct in chaffinches is already considerably reduced in late April / May, which would prevent them from flying over a large body of water towards E or NE.

	<p>Tables 5, 6, and 7 (below) show details in the migration behavior of two thrush species, <i>Turdus merula</i> (Blackbird)&nbsp; and <i>Turdus viscivorus</i> (Mistle Thrush). In each year, about half of the total number of <i>T. merula</i> migrated in the first hour after sunrise, and migration ceased until late morning / noon. In <i>T. viscivorus</i>, however, just ca. 20% of the individuals migrated in the first hour after sunrise, and a migration peak appeared in late morning / noon. Similar results have been found in the Netherlands (LWVT/SOVON 2002: pp. 205 and 213; see diagrams "Doortrek over de dag"). An explanation for this difference could be that <i>T. merula</i> prefers to migrate during night and in the early morning (see Brüchle-Ulmer and Hemprich 1999), and <i>T. viscivorus</i> is more a diurnal migrant.</p>
